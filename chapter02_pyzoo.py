"""OOP Zoo - Exercise 2.5 of next.py course.

In this python zoo, based on object oriented programing, there are
classes for each type of animal - all inheriting from the general
Animal super-class. All the animals are instances of these classes,
but each with its own attributes values. They will all be fed (if
needed), asked to "talk" and to do something special.

* Developed & tested with Python 3.8
* Passed code style check (pycodestyle --statistics --count chapter02_pyzoo.py).

Exercise tasks summery:
1. Make Animal class with name and hunger attributes.
2. Make Dog, Cat, Skunk, Unicorn and Dragon classes.
3. Implement get_name, is_hungry and feed methods.
4. Add main function that will:
    a. Create instances of given class types with given initial
       attributes values.
    b. Add all instances to one list.
    c. Traverse list, printing each animal's type and name, and feeding
       it till it isn't hungry.
5. Add talk method to Animal class, and override it in each subclass.
   Use it after using the feed method.
6. For each animal sub class, implement a special method. Use it after
   using the talk method.
7. Implement extra attribute for Skunk and Dragon classes with given
   default values.
8. Add 5 more instances of animals.
9. Add zoo_name as a class attribute with the value "Hayaton". Print it
   once at the end of the program.
